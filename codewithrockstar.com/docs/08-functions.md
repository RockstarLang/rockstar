summary: Like many of the fine rock'n'rollers who inspired it, Rockstar can't really be said to be  functional - but it does have functions.
---
Functions are declared with a variable name followed by the `takes` keyword (alias `wants`) and a list of arguments separated by one of the following: `and` `,` `&` `, and` `'n'`

{% rockstar_include functions.rock %}

Functions can be one-liners, usually written with the `giving` keyword:

{% rockstar_include one-line-functions.rock %}

Function bodies can also be a block. Functions in Rockstar specified by the `return` keyword and its aliases `giving`, `give`, `give back` and `send`. A return statement can be followed by the keyword `back` (which has no effect but can make code more lyrical).

{% rockstar_include polly-wants-a-cracker.rock %}

Functions are called using the ‘taking’ keyword and must have at least one argument. Multiple arguments are separated with one of the following: `,` `&` `, and` `'n'`.

Function arguments must be primary expressions:

{% rockstar_include function-calls-as-arguments.rock %}

> The reason you can't use operators inside function arguments is that it makes it awkward to write recursive function calls. Consider this expression
>
> ```
> result = foo taking 1 + foo taking 2
> ```
> ...is that `foo(1 + foo(2)`, or `foo(1 + foo(2))`? Without using parentheses to surround function arguments, the parser can't disambiguate between the two - and since there's no way we're putting parentheses in Rockstar, the only solution is to disallow operators in function arguments.

This is also one of the few features where the language **grammar** is ambiguous, and what's produced by the parser doesn't necessarily match what's executed by the interpreter. The parser is greedy and it doesn't know anything about how many arguments a function takes (its *arity*), so this expression:

```rockstar
 FuncA taking FuncB taking 1, 2, FuncB taking 3, 4
 ```

will produce this parse tree:

```
function call: FuncA  
  function call: FuncB  
    1  
    2  
    function call: FuncB  
      3  
      4
```

Thing is, FuncB doesn't take three arguments - so rather than failing, the Rockstar interpreter only evaluates as many function arguments as the function is expecting, and any "leftover" expressions will be passed back to the outer function call, so what actually gets executed is:

```
call: FuncA
  args:
  1: call: FuncB:
     args:
     1: number: 1
     2: number: 2
  2: call: FuncB    }
     args:          } FuncB only expects two arguments, so
     1: number: 3   } the interpreter passes this one to the
     2: number: 4   } outermost function instead.
```

Functions can contain other functions, and because every function defines its own variable scope, nested functions can have the same names as the functions which enclose them. *(I have no idea why you would ever want to do this, but making it impossible would have been really difficult.)*

{% rockstar_include nested-functions.rock %}

To declare a function with no arguments, specify it `takes null` (or aliases `nothing`, `nowhere`, `nobody`). To call a function with no arguments, use the `call` keyword, or suffix the function name with an exclamation mark:

{% rockstar_include functions-with-no-arguments.rock %}

### Variables, Closures and Function Scope
Rockstar uses the same scoping mechanism as JavaScript:

* Variables are global unless you declare them with `let`
* Global variables aren't *really* global unless they're declared at the top level of your program.

In this example, calling `My function` initialises two variables:

{% rockstar_include function-scope.rock %}

You can declare variables inside functions, functions can contain other functions, and declaring a function inside another function creates a *closure*, which captures the state of any variables that existed when the function was declared.

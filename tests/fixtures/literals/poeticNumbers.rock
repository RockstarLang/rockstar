Tommy was a lovestruck ladykiller
say Tommy

Sweet Lucy was a dancer
say Sweet Lucy

A killer is on the loose
whisper a killer

My dreams were ice. A life unfulfilled; wakin' everybody up, taking booze and pills
shout My dreams

Sweet Lucy's a danger to society
say Sweet Lucy

my number is a 57 + true 43
say my number

The streets are lonely
say the streets

My dream is diamond nightmares
Your love is meaningless to me
Rock my dream like a razorblade smile
Rock my dream with your love, your love
Shout my dream at 0
Shout my dream at 1
Shout my dream at 2
Shout my dream at 3
Shout my dream at 4

Roll my dream into the dark
Cast the dark into the fire
Shout the fire

Roll my dream into the dark
Cast the dark into the fire
Shout the fire

Roll my dream into the dark
Cast the dark into the fire
Shout the fire

Roll my dream into the dark
Cast the dark into the fire
Shout the fire
